# Personal-Performance-Analytics-Dashboard

Project Overview

A Google Sheets dashboard that tracks and analyzes my personal productivity and performance metrics. 
The project demonstrates my ability to **clean**, **structure**, and **visualize** data using **spreadsheet functions** and **dynamic scorecards and charts**.

## Motivation

I built this project to:

Track my own daily habits and performance.

Practice real-world data analysis using Google Sheets.

Showcase dashboard design and storytelling skills for a junior data analyst role.



## Data & Tools

Data Source: Self-recorded daily performance metrics (deep work hours, exercise, reading, etc.).

Tools Used:

Google Sheets (data cleaning, formulas, charts, conditional formatting)

Google Sheets Functions (e.g., QUERY, ARRAYFORMULA, IF, VLOOKUP, MATCH, )

Dynamic visualizations (area charts, bar charts, column charts, scorecards, pie charts, trend lines)
