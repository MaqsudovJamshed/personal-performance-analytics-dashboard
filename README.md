# Personal-Performance-Analytics-Dashboard

Project Overview

A Google Sheets dashboard that tracks and analyzes my personal productivity and performance metrics.

The project demonstrates my ability to **clean**, **structure**, and **visualize** data using **spreadsheet functions** and **dynamic scorecards and charts**.

## Motivation

I built this project to:

Track my habits and performance over both the short and long term.

Practice data analysis with real personal data that reflects my life.

Gain insights to improve key metrics like productivity and consistency.

Blend self-tracking with a professional analytics approach to demonstrate skills relevant for a junior data analyst role.



## Data & Tools

Data Source: Self-recorded daily performance metrics (e.g., deep work hours, exercise, reading).

Tools Used:

Google Sheets → data cleaning, formulas, pivot tables, conditional formatting.


                                                Functions:

Aggregation → COUNT, SUM, COUNTIF, SUMIF

Statistical → AVERAGE, AVERAGEIFS, MIN, MAX

Filtering & Lookup → FILTER, INDEX, MATCH

Date Functions → ISOWEEKNUM, WEEKNUM, MONTH


Visualizations → area charts, bar charts, column charts, pie charts, trend lines, scorecards.



## Methodology

**Data Collection** : Recorded daily performance metrics over 18 weeks.

**Data Cleaning**:    Standardized inputs, ensured completeness, and created helper fields (e.g., extracting week numbers, months, and weekdays).

**Analysis**:         Built calculated fields such as streaks, averages, percentages, cumulative totals, and actual vs. target comparisons.

**Visualization**:   Designed scorecards and charts including:

- Weekly and monthly averages
- Monthly cumulative values
- Moving averages for trend smoothing
- Actual vs. target comparisons
- Consistency rates (% of days habit completed)

**Monitoring & Diagnosis**: Used the dashboard to provide a clear, descriptive view of the health of habits and progress over time.

Key Insights

Found that increasing deep work hours by 1 hr/day improved overall productivity score by X%.

Visualized daily vs. target metrics for clear performance tracking.

Identified areas where I was over/under-performing against targets.
