# Personal-Performance-Analytics-Dashboard

Project Overview

A Google Sheets dashboard that tracks and analyzes my personal productivity and performance metrics.

The project demonstrates my ability to **clean**, **structure**, and **visualize** data using **spreadsheet functions** and **dynamic scorecards and charts**.

## Motivation

I built this project to:

Track my habits and performance over both the short and long term.

Practice data analysis with real personal data that reflects my life.

Gain insights to improve key metrics like productivity and consistency.

Blend self-tracking with a professional analytics approach to demonstrate skills relevant for a junior data analyst role.



## Data & Tools

Data Source: Self-recorded daily performance metrics (e.g., deep work hours, exercise, reading).

Tools Used:

Google Sheets → data cleaning, formulas, pivot tables, conditional formatting.


                                                Functions:

Aggregation → COUNT, SUM, COUNTIF, SUMIF

Statistical → AVERAGE, AVERAGEIFS, MIN, MAX

Filtering & Lookup → FILTER, INDEX, MATCH

Date Functions → ISOWEEKNUM, WEEKNUM, MONTH


Visualizations → area charts, bar charts, column charts, pie charts, trend lines, scorecards.















## Methodology

Data Collection: Recorded daily metrics over X weeks.

Data Cleaning: Standardized inputs and handled missing values.

Analysis: Created calculated fields (e.g., streaks, averages, targets vs. actual).

Visualization: Built a dynamic dashboard with charts and KPIs.

Insights: Identified patterns between deep work and productivity.
