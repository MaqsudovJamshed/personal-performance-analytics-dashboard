ðŸ“Š  1. Project Background & Overview

To better understand my daily habits and optimize my productivity, I decided to build a *Personal Productivity & Performance Tracker*. Before this, I relied on manual **to-do lists** and **monthly habit** reviews, which made it difficult to **identify patterns** and **analyze trends** effectively. To address this, I created a dynamic dashboard to centralize daily, weekly, monthly, and all-time metrics in one place. 

The dashboard focuses primarily on descriptive analytics, allowing me to monitor the health of my habits over different time periods through automated data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization.

By tracking these metrics dynamically, I regularly draw meaningful insights about my habits and make data-driven decisions to continuously improve my productivity.

Insights & recommendations are provided on the following habits: 
- Planning the Day 
- Journaling
- Deep Work Hours
- Daily Reading
- Workout 
- Steps
- Diet Followed
- Daily Weight
- Calorie Deficit
- Sleep
- Screen Time
