ðŸ“Š  1. Project Background & Overview

The Personal Productivity & Performance Tracker was developed to analyze daily habits and optimize productivity. Traditionally, manual to-do lists and monthly habit reviews make it challenging to identify patterns or analyze trends effectively. To address this, a dynamic dashboard was created to centralize daily, weekly, monthly, and all-time metrics in one place.

The dashboard focuses primarily on descriptive analytics, enabling the monitoring of the health of habits over different time periods through automated data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization. By tracking these metrics dynamically, the dashboard provides actionable insights that support data-driven decisions to continuously improve productivity.


Insights and recommendations are generated in the following key areas:

* **Time Series Analysis** (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, All-Time): Evaluates trends and patterns in key metrics by examining average values, cumulative totals, longest streaks, and consistency over time, and comparing performance against targets and moving averages.

* **Performance Benchmarking**: Compares current performance against personal goals or targets and analyzes month-over-month improvements to measure progress and identify areas for optimization.

* **Visualization & Dashboarding**: Uses charts, tables, and conditional formatting to highlight trends, outliers, streaks, and progress dynamically over different time periods.
